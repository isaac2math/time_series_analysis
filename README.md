# time_series_analysis

In this file, I included all the codes and packages for the statistics course "time series analysis" I teach at 2020 S1 and S2

I use Python, R, Matlab, Julia and Stata algether, unless some package is missing for certain kinds of languages

The codes covers

* Basic operations (estimation, prediction, test,...) for OLS
* AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA
* Trend decomposition and SARIMA
* Different smoothing techniques (exponential, Holt-Winters,..., etc)
* VAR, ECM
* Different statistical tests (ADF, Ljung-Box, ..., etc) for time series analysis.
* Bayes net model for time series (Hidden Markov Model, ... etc)
* Recurrent neural network
* Signal processing techniques using Fourier and Laplace transforms
* Basic filtering methods (like Kalman filter)
* More will appear here
