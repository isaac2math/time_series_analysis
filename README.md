# time_series_analysis
> all the codes and packages for the statistics course "time series analysis" I teach at 2020 S1 and S2

I use Python, R, Matlab/Octave, Julia and Stata (C++ somewhere for backend programming of R and Matlab) altogether, unless some package is missing for certain kinds of languages.

I just love to collect all codes into Jupyter kernel for better demostration.

Please note that 

* **the HEGY test is missing in Python. I will develop it myself; however, due to extra heavy teaching load, I cannot guarantee that I will finish it in time**

The codes covers

* Basic operations (estimation, prediction, test,...) for OLS
* AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA
* Trend decomposition and SARIMA
* Different smoothing techniques (exponential, Holt-Winters,..., etc)
* VAR, ECM
* Different statistical tests (ADF, Ljung-Box, ..., etc) for time series analysis.
* Bayes net model for time series (Hidden Markov Model, ... etc)
* Recurrent neural network
* Signal processing techniques using Fourier and Laplace transforms
* Basic filtering methods (Kalman filter,... etc)
* More will appear here
